## Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## Description

This Python project is built using Flask to serve as a backend service that interacts with a MongoDB database. It processes POST requests by extracting a reference number from the request, querying a MongoDB collection for data related to that reference number, and generating a summary using the Langchain library with OpenAI's language models.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the application, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Google Cloud SDK (for deploying to App Engine)

## Local Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Set up your MongoDB instance and ensure that you have the correct connection string in your `main.py`.

6. Run the application:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Deployment on Google Cloud App Engine

1. Ensure that you have an active Google Cloud project and that you are authenticated via the `gcloud` CLI.
2. Edit the `app.yaml` file to suit your specific configuration needs for App Engine.
3. Deploy the application using the `gcloud` command:

   ```bash
   gcloud app deploy
   ```

4. Monitor your deployment on the Google Cloud Console under the App Engine section.

## Usage

To use the application, send a POST request to `/api/process` with a JSON body containing a `referenceNumber`. Example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/process \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"referenceNumber": "your_reference_number_here"}'
```
